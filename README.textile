--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

h2. Known issues:

* thumbnails using @{{thumbnail}}@ macro will not be shown in exported PDFs
  (another Redmine's PDF export limit - see http://www.redmine.org/issues/13051)
* maximum attachment size is checked against BASE64 encoded image data (even
  smaller images than the maximum allowed attachment size can be rejected)
* clipboard_image_paste's 'Add picture from clipboard' command combines number
  of both regular files and pasted images for maximum number of attachment check,
  while Redmine's original 'Add another file' counts only regular files
* ability to copy&paste images from clipboard depends on browsers capabilities
  - some browsers don't support all image formats in the clipboard
* Redmine 2.5 and older: attached image will be visibile in exported PDFs only 
  if RMagick is installed (this is a limit of PDF export in Redmine - alpha channel 
  must be removed from png image)
* see Compatibility section for incompatible plug-ins
